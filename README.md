Stress Free Learning is a project with the aim of developing a swarm robotics tool for the detection of learning difficulties in children.
The test has 3 stages with several substages each:
1. Letters:
1.1) Error correction (find the error in the assembled word);
1.2) Fill the gap (several options to fill a gap in the assembled word);
1.3) Hear & Assemble (audio file is played and the child is asked to assemble the corresponding word);
1.4) Freeplay (assemble as many valid words as possible within a time limit).
2. Words: same substages as for the letters but forming sentences instead of words.
3. Connect The Numbers:
3.1) Counting up (follow the numbers: 1, 2, 3...; the goal is to get the child acquainted with the controls);
3.2) Easy math (follow the sequence according to simple maths equations, e.g. 3 + 12)
3.3) Advanced math (follow the sequence according to more complex maths equations appropriate for the child's age group)
